The packages necessary to run our code are included in the file requirements.txt. We included two videos that shows our code working with Rasa and Slack.



# Extra Tasks Completed
Rasa Interface:
We got Rasa to work on the user story on Canvas using our recipe functions. A demo video was recorded and included in our submission.

Slack Chatbot:
We deployed our code using the slack platform. The user can join our slack channel and ask the bot questions.

Substitution:
We add the feature to look up available substitutions as well as browse build-in terms and descriptors.

Because Slack will revoke our access to the bot if we post the authorization code on Git, we will not include it in our submission. Please contact us if there are any questions regarding it.
